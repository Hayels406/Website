    "text": "Paw Print Blanket\nMy sister-in-law wanted a “chunky blanket with pompoms” for her baby due in October 2023. I found a pattern for this paw print blanket on Etsy and make her baby a massive blanket using chunky Trimm Velvet yarn in grey and white and a 7mm hook. The main body of the blanket is made from single crochet and the paw prints are made of bobble stitches. The pattern called for 500g of each to do 3 blocks of white and 2 blocks of grey. However, I needed much more than that. To complete 2 blocks of each colour I used 600g of both colours and ran out of grey.\nThings learnt:\n\nHow to switch colours mid-row\nHow to bobble stitch\nHow to fix a hole in a row"
